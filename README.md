# Social_Media_Mental_Health-Prediction
This project investigates the impact of digital habits on mental well-being. Using a dataset of 5,000 observations, we developed a machine learning pipeline to classify users' mental states into three categories: Healthy, At Risk, or Stressed. The goal is to identify "Digital Biomarkers" that can provide early warnings for mental distress.
